# Fake-Profile Detection
Fake profile is a problem associated with online social networks. Normally, people are prompted to create fake accounts on basis of seeking popularity or spreading artificial popularity to a particular target group of people. Users of various accounts create fake profiles to stand out from others with an artificial show of how people are visiting their accounts. Fake profile creation could be because of spreading fame or attracting growing industries/companies to advertise with the profile creators. This activity follows the working of online social networks algorithms. OSNs usually connect advertisers with users with a high number of traffic to their accounts.
The main objective is to create a model that will detect fake profile and can limit this activity. We will use Instagram dataset for training and testing models to detect fake profiles
